# Enterprise Network Penetration Testing

## Project Overview

This project involved conducting a comprehensive security assessment of a mid-sized financial services organization's network infrastructure. The engagement followed industry-standard methodologies to identify vulnerabilities and provide actionable remediation strategies.

### Key Objectives
- Assess network security posture
- Identify critical vulnerabilities
- Test incident response capabilities
- Provide remediation roadmap
- Enhance security awareness

## Technical Scope

### Network Infrastructure
- **IP Range:** 192.168.1.0/24 - 192.168.10.0/24
- **Hosts:** 45 active systems
- **Services:** Web applications, databases, file servers
- **Operating Systems:** Windows Server 2016/2019, Windows 10, Linux Ubuntu

### Testing Methodology
- **External Testing:** Black-box approach from internet perspective
- **Internal Testing:** Gray-box testing with limited network access
- **Framework:** OWASP WSTG, NIST SP 800-115, PTES

## Attack Vectors Explored

### 1. Network Reconnaissance
```bash
# Host discovery
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
masscan -p1-65535 192.168.1.0/24 --rate=1000

# Service enumeration
nmap -sS -sV -sC -O -A target-range
nmap --script vuln target-range
```

### 2. Web Application Testing
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Authentication bypass
- Directory traversal
- File upload vulnerabilities

### 3. Network Service Exploitation
- SMB vulnerabilities (EternalBlue)
- Weak authentication protocols
- Unencrypted communications
- Default credentials

## Critical Findings

### High-Risk Vulnerabilities

1. **CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue)**
   - **CVSS Score:** 9.3
   - **Impact:** Remote code execution
   - **Affected Systems:** 3 Windows 7 workstations

2. **SQL Injection in Customer Portal**
   - **CVSS Score:** 9.1
   - **Impact:** Database compromise
   - **Data at Risk:** Customer financial records

3. **Default Credentials**
   - **CVSS Score:** 9.8
   - **Impact:** Complete system compromise
   - **Affected:** Network infrastructure devices

### Exploitation Chain

The most critical attack path involved:

1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting unpatched EternalBlue vulnerability
2. **Privilege Escalation:** Leveraging unquoted service paths
3. **Credential Harvesting:** Using Mimikatz for password extraction
4. **Lateral Movement:** Pass-the-hash attacks across domain
5. **Persistence:** Scheduled task backdoors

## Tools and Techniques

### Reconnaissance Tools
- **Nmap:** Network discovery and port scanning
- **Masscan:** High-speed port scanning
- **DNSrecon:** DNS enumeration
- **TheHarvester:** OSINT gathering

### Vulnerability Assessment
- **Nessus:** Automated vulnerability scanning
- **OpenVAS:** Open-source vulnerability scanner
- **Nikto:** Web server scanner

### Exploitation Frameworks
- **Metasploit:** Automated exploitation
- **Cobalt Strike:** Advanced threat simulation
- **PowerShell Empire:** Post-exploitation framework

### Post-Exploitation
- **Mimikatz:** Credential extraction
- **BloodHound:** Active Directory mapping
- **PowerSploit:** PowerShell exploitation modules

## Impact Assessment

### Business Risk
- **Financial Impact:** Potential $2.5M in regulatory fines
- **Operational Risk:** 72-hour downtime scenario
- **Compliance:** PCI DSS, SOX violations
- **Reputation:** Customer trust erosion

### Technical Risk
- **Data Confidentiality:** BREACHED
- **System Integrity:** COMPROMISED
- **Service Availability:** AT RISK

## Remediation Strategy

### Immediate Actions (0-48 hours)
```powershell
# Patch EternalBlue
Get-WindowsUpdate -Install -AcceptAll
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb1protocol

# Reset default credentials
net user administrator /random
```

### Short-term (1-4 weeks)
1. **Network Segmentation**
   - Implement VLANs
   - Deploy next-gen firewalls
   - Micro-segmentation strategy

2. **Access Controls**
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Privileged access management
   - Regular access reviews

### Long-term (1-6 months)
1. **Security Monitoring**
   - SIEM deployment
   - EDR implementation
   - 24/7 SOC services

2. **Security Program Enhancement**
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Vulnerability management
   - Security awareness training

## Lessons Learned

### Key Insights
1. **Patch Management is Critical**
   - Unpatched systems were primary entry points
   - Automated patching reduces risk by 85%

2. **Defense in Depth Works**
   - Multiple security layers prevented total compromise
   - Network segmentation limited lateral movement

3. **Human Factor Remains Vulnerable**
   - Social engineering attempts had 60% success rate
   - Security awareness training is essential

### Recommendations for Future Testing
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Red team exercises
- Purple team collaborations
- Threat hunting activities
